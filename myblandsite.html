         <div class="about_me">hi! i am divyansh, a student. i do other stuff than just being a "student" stuff as well, like desigining qc circuits, rocket test pads and recording podcasts. you can check those things out on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/divyanshgunjan/" target="_blank">linkedin</a>. you may not actively find me anywhere else. You can check out my <a href="https://twitter.com/divyanshgunjan" target="_blank">X</a> as well though.
        currently, i am a science student pursuing PCM at a local school in Patna as a non-attending individual. i skipped my current year of <i>possibly</i> going to college. i got into penn state, drexel, state schools in texas, unis in arizona, some in nyc; most of the schools I applied to. This year I will be prepping for IIT(i have been a pathetic test taker forever), but I will try. i love rockets and materials and hardware but my rank doesn't concern my interest, does it?
        I have been fascinated by space since the age of 9, when my father brought me a few encyclopediae/s. they were a NICE, quick read. recently a few materials like graphene and nitinol(idk anything about these) have caught my attention. why materials? just like every other naive believer, i believe they can change the world. How? 42. just kidding, too long for now.
        research is fun. what do i like? space(as told before). what do i not like? School(it's a torture); it comes in the way of the individual's education. how will i do it? idk. why will i do it? because's it is the right thing to do. <br>peace ✌️
